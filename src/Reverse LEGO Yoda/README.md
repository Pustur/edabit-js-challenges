# Reverse LEGO Yoda

`Formatting` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/etjdtp5KGC2vYP6fn)

Create a function that takes a string with at least one sentence in it and returns a string with the part(s) after the comma at the beginning of the sentence(s).

### Examples

```js
reverseLegoYoda("Hit you with my stick, I shall.")
➞ "I shall hit you with my stick."

reverseLegoYoda("Rejected me, my crush has. Ketamine, I need.")
➞ "My crush has rejected me. I need ketamine."

reverseLegoYoda("An alien, I am. Holding me captive in Area 51, the government is.")
➞ "I am an alien. The government is holding me captive in Area 51."
```

### Notes

- Pay close attention to letter cases.
- Sentences will always end with a period.
- There will always be exactly one comma in each of the sentences.
