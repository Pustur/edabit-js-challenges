# Solving Exponential Equations With Logarithms

`Algorithms` `Math` `Numbers`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/PXau3Fzk8GXgF6oRQ)

Create a function that takes a number `a` and finds the missing exponent _x_ so that `a` when raised to the power of _x_ is equal to `b`.

### Examples

```js
solveForExp(4, 1024) ➞ 5

solveForExp(2, 1024) ➞ 10

solveForExp(9, 3486784401) ➞ 10
```

### Notes

`a` is raised to the power of what in order to equal `b`?
