# Find the Characters Counterpart Char Code

`Formatting` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/fbaLZPNjTvYtY444B)

Create a function that takes a single character as an argument and returns the char code of its lowercased / uppercased counterpart.

### Examples

```js
Given that:
  - "A" char code is: 65
  - "a" char code is: 97

counterpartCharCode("A") ➞ 97

counterpartCharCode("a") ➞ 65
```

### Notes

- The argument will always be a single character.
- Not all inputs will have a counterpart (e.g. numbers), in which case return the inputs char code.
