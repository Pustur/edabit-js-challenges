Create a function that takes an integer argument and returns an array of prime numbers found in the decimal representation of that number.

For example, `extractPrimes(1717)` returns `[7, 7, 17, 17, 71]`.

The array should be in acending order. If a prime number appears more than once, every occurance should be listed. If no prime numbers are found, return an empty array.

### Examples

```js
extractPrimes(1) ➞ []

extractPrimes(7) ➞ [7]

extractPrimes(73) ➞ [3, 7, 37]

extractPrimes(1313) ➞ [3, 3, 13, 13, 31, 131, 313]
```

### Notes

All test cases are positive real integers.
