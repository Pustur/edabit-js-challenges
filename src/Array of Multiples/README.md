[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/ebcd4Xu8TLizaj6dm)

Create a function that takes two numbers as arguments (`num`, `length`) and returns an array of multiples of `num` up to `length`.

### Examples

```js
arrayOfMultiples(7, 5) ➞ [7, 14, 21, 28, 35]

arrayOfMultiples(12, 10) ➞ [12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, 84, 96, 108, 120]

arrayOfMultiples(17, 6) ➞ [17, 34, 51, 68, 85, 102, 119]
```

### Notes

Notice that `num` is also included in the returned array.
