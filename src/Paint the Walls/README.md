Given a predetermined rate from an object, write the function that will return the time it takes for a certain amount of people to paint a certain amount of walls. Return the minutes as an integer. No rounding is necessary.

### Example

```js
// It takes 22 minutes for 10 people to paint 10 walls.
// How many minutes does it take 14 people to paint 14 walls?

let rate = {
  people: 10,
  walls: 10,
  minutes: 22
}

time(rate, people, walls) âžž 22
```
