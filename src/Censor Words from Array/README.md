### Examples

```js
censorString("Today is a Wednesday!", ["Today", "a"], "-") ➞ "----- is - Wednesday!"

censorString("The cow jumped over the moon.", ["cow", "over"], "*"), "The *** jumped **** the moon.")

censorString("Why did the chicken cross the road?", ["Did", "chicken", "road"], "*") ➞ "Why *** the ******* cross the ****?"
```
