Create a function that takes an array of three numbers as an argument and returns the LCM.

### Examples

```js
[5, 7, 13] ➞ 455

[104, 105, 107] ➞ 1168440

[19, 47, 43] ➞ 38399
```

### Notes

In math, the LCM is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of two or more numbers. In our case, we are dealing with three numbers.

Multiples of 3 are: 3, 6, 9, 12, and so on. Multiples of 4 are: 4, 8,12, and so on. Multiples of 12 are: 12, and so on.

Thus the least common multiple of 3, 4, and 12 is 12.
