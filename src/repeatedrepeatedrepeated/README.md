`Language Fundamentals` `Numbers` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/RTGusMtBRRdE5ivEP)

This challenge concerns strings such as:

```js
'repeatedrepeatedrepeated';
```

... that are obtained by repeating a smaller string, which in this case is the string `"repeated"`.

On a related note, since the string above is made of 3 repetitions, one way to produce this string is via the code `"repeated".repeat(3)`.

Write a function that, given a string, either:

- Returns `false` if the string isn't made by repeating a smaller string or ...
- Returns **the number of repetitions** if the string repeats a smaller string.

### Examples

```js
isRepeated("repeatedrepeatedrepeated") âžž 3

isRepeated("overintellectualizations") âžž False

isRepeated("nononononononononononono") âžž 12

isRepeated("moremoremoremoremoremore") âžž 6

isRepeated(",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,") âžž 24
```

### Notes

To keep things a little simpler, all strings in the tests will have length exactly 24, just as in all the examples above. In particular, the answers will always be divisors of 24.
