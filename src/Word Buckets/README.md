# Word Buckets

`Control Flow` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/Q7foiyejfJG6pqqws)

Write a function that divides a phrase into word buckets, with each bucket containing `n` or fewer characters. Only include full words inside each bucket.

### Examples

```js
bucketize("she sells sea shells by the sea", 10)
➞ ["she sells", "sea shells", "by the sea"]

bucketize("the mouse jumped over the cheese", 7)
➞ ["the", "mouse", "jumped", "over", "the", "cheese"]

bucketize("fairy dust coated the air", 20)
➞ ["fairy dust coated", "the air"]

bucketize("a b c d e", 2)
➞ ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
```

### Notes

- Spaces count as one character.
- Trim beginning and end spaces for each word bucket (see final example).
- If buckets are too small to hold a single word, return an empty array: `[]`
