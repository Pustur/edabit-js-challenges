# Coding Website Score Calculator

`Math` `Numbers`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/49xuWj6G4yB6MfvWG)

Imagine you run a website that presents users with different coding challenges in levels Easy, Medium, and Hard, where users get points for completing challenges. An Easy challenge is worth `5` points, a Medium challenge is worth `10` points, and a Hard challenge is worth `20` points.

Create a function that takes in the number of each challenge level a user has played and calculates the user's total number of points. Keep in mind that a user cannot complete negative challenges, so the function should return the string "invalid" if any of the passed parameters is negative.

### Examples

```js
scoreCalculator(1, 2, 3) ➞ 85

scoreCalculator(1, 0, 10) ➞ 205

scoreCalculator(5, 2, -6) ➞ "invalid"
```
