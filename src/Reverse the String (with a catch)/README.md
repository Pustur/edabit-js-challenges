# Reverse the String (with a catch)

`Formatting` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/AcL4HiKbC9cYSHmYt)

Create a function that takes a string and returns the reversed string. However there's a few rules to follow in order to make the challenge interesting:

- The UPPERCASE/lowercase positions must be kept in the same order as the original string (see example #1 and #2).
- Spaces must be kept in the same order as the original string (see example #3).

### Examples

```js
specialReverseString("Edabit") ➞ "Tibade"

specialReverseString("UPPER lower") ➞ "REWOL reppu"

specialReverseString("1 23 456") ➞ "6 54 321"
```
