Create a function that takes a number as an argument and returns `"Fizz"`, `"Buzz"` or `"FizzBuzz"`.

- If the number is a multiple of 3 the output should be `"Fizz"`.
- If the number given is 5 the output should be `"Buzz"`.
- If the number given is a multiple of both 3 and 5, the output should be `"FizzBuzz"`.
- If the number is not a multiple of either 3 or 5, the number should be output on its own as shown in the examples below.

### Examples

```js
FizzBuzz(3) ➞ "Fizz"

FizzBuzz(5) ➞ "Buzz"

FizzBuzz(15) ➞ "FizzBuzz"

FizzBuzz(4) ➞ 4
```
