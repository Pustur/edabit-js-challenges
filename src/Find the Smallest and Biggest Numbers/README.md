# Find the Smallest and Biggest Numbers

`Arrays` `Numbers`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/Q3n42rEWanZSTmsJm)

Create a function that takes an array of numbers and return both the minimum and maximum numbers, in that order.

### Examples

```js
minMax([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ [1, 5]

minMax([2334454, 5]) ➞ [5, 2334454]

minMax([1]) ➞ [1, 1]
```

### Notes

All test arrays will have at least one element and are valid.
