**Mubashir** is not so good with the English language. He needs your help to correct his sentences.

1.  Start each sentence with an **uppercase alphabet**.
2.  For every uppercase letter (other than the first alphabet), you have to place a **fullstop(.) followed by an empty space**.
3.  There must be only **one space** between the words and sentences.
4.  Sentence must end with a **full stop(.)**
5.  **Two continuous spaces** are not allowed.

```js
correctSentences ("  mubashir loves  edabit  Matt  loves  edabit  ") ➞ "Mubashir loves edabit. Matt loves edabit."

// Remove extra spaces.
// Capitalise first character.
// Dot followed by an empty space before "Matt".
// A dot at the end.
```
