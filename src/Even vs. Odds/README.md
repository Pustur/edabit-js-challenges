Odd numbers like to hangout with odd numbers. Even numbers like to hangout with even numbers.

A **spot** is an insertion between two numbers in an array. Given an array of **n** integers in length, there are **n-1** spots available.

For instance:

```js
[3, 4, 9, 10, 1]; // Array of 5 digits can also be thought of as...

[3, __, 4, __, 9, __, 10, __, 1]; // ...an array of 4 spots.
```

After a number is newly inserted into a **spot**, it's **left neighbor** is the number directly to the left of it and it's **right neighbor** is the number directly to the right of it.

For instance:

```js
[3, 6, 4, 9, 10, 1]; // Left neighbor of 6 is 3, right neighbor of 6 is 4.
```

Odd numbers like having the following **(left neighbor, right neighbor combinations)**: `(odd, even), (even, odd), (odd, odd)` .They **dislike** having both neighbors being even, or `(even, even)`.

Similarly, even numbers like the following neighbor combinations: `(even, odd), (odd, even), (even, even)`. They **dislike** having both neighbors being odd, or `(odd, odd)`.

Given an array, calculate the number of liked spots.

### Examples

```js
availableSpots([0, 4, 6, 8], 9) ➞ 0
// 9 likes NONE of the following spots: [0, __, 4], [4, __ , 6], [6, __, 8] b/c all of his neighbors are even.

availableSpots([0, 4, 6, 8], 12) ➞ 3
// 12 likes ALL of the spots.

availableSpots([4, 4, 4, 4, 5], 7) ➞ 1
// 7 dislikes every spot except the last one at: [4, __, 5].

availableSpots([4, 4], 8) ➞ 1
```
