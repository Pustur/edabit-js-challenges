# Basic Statistics: Median

`Arrays` `Math` `Numbers`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/PdooZppJkpCGiJHCf)

The _median_ of a group of numbers is the _middle_ number when the group is sorted. If the size of the group is even, the median is the _average_ of the middle two numbers. Given a sorted array of numbers, return the median (rounded to one decimal place if the median isn't an integer).

### Examples

```js
median([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 8, 8, 10]) ➞ 6

median([2, 2, 6, 8, 8, 10, 10]) ➞ 8

median([1, 2, 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10]) ➞ 5.5
```
