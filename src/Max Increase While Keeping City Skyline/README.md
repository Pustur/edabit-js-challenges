# Max Increase While Keeping City Skyline

`Arrays` `Loops` `Math`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/zLNho5QD5LcZReZxi)

In a 2 dimensional array, each value represents the height of a building located there. You are allowed to increase the height of any number of buildings, by any amount (the amounts can be different for different buildings).

At the end, the "skyline" when viewed from all four directions of the grid, i.e. top, bottom, left, and right, must be the same as the skyline of the original grid. A city's skyline is the outer contour of the rectangles formed by all the buildings when viewed from a distance.

### Examples

```js
[
  [3, 0, 8, 4],
  [2, 4, 5, 7],
  [9, 2, 6, 3],
  [0, 3, 1, 0],
];

// Skyline viewed from top or bottom: [9, 4, 8, 7]
// Skyline viewed from left or right: [8, 7, 9, 3]

[
  [8, 0, 8, 7],
  [7, 4, 7, 7],
  [9, 4, 8, 7],
  [0, 3, 3, 0],
];

// Grid after increasing the height of buildings without affecting skylines.
```

### Notes

Height `0` is considered to be a protected park and nothing should be built on top of it.
