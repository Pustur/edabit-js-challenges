# Sample Points from a Curve

`Algebra` `Arrays` `Math`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/9se2zfxxSrLPKpyH9)

Create a function that given a type of `curve` will generate an array containing a `samples` amount of numbers calculated from said `curve`.

It's easier to see with a visual representation:

If `samples = 3` and `curve = "pow"`, we would sample 3 points along the **x axis** `[0, 0.5, 1]` and figure out the value of `y`, in the case of the `pow` curve the values are `[0, 0.25, 1]`.

### Examples

```js
samplesFromCurve(3, "linear") ➞ [0, 0.5, 1]

samplesFromCurve(3, "pow") ➞ [0, 0.25, 1]

samplesFromCurve(3, "sqrt") ➞ [0, 0.71, 1]

samplesFromCurve(5, "linear") ➞ [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]
```

### Notes

- The available curves are `linear`, `pow`, `sqrt` as shown in the picture.
- All values returned must have a **maximum of 2 decimals** to avoid floating point problems in the tests.
- All values returned must be between `0` and `1` (inclusive).
- The `samples` parameter will always be ≥ `2`.
- The samples are **evenly distributed** along the **x axis**.
