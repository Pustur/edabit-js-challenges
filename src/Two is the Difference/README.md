# Two is the Difference

`Arrays` `Numbers`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/nDQugFjducBmKXyFf)

Create a function that takes an array of integers and returns all pairs of integers that have a **difference of two**. The resulting array should be sorted in **ascending order** of values.

### Examples

```js
differenceTwo([1, 2, 3, 4]) ➞ [[1, 3], [2, 4]]

differenceTwo([1, 23, 3, 4, 7]) ➞ [[1, 3]]

differenceTwo([4, 3, 1, 5, 6]) ➞ [[1, 3], [3, 5], [4, 6]]
```

### Notes

Assume there are no duplicate integers in the array. The order of the integers in the input array should not matter.
