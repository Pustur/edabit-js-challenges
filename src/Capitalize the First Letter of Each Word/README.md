Create a function that takes a string as an argument and converts the first character of each word to uppercase. Return the newly formatted string.

### Examples

makeTitle("This is a title") ➞ "This Is A Title"

makeTitle("capitalize every word") ➞ "Capitalize Every Word"

makeTitle("I Like Pizza") ➞ "I Like Pizza"

makeTitle("PIZZA PIZZA PIZZA") ➞ "PIZZA PIZZA PIZZA"
