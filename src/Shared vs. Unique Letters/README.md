# Shared vs. Unique Letters

`Arrays` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/64JH2CWhLNkbzfRYW)

Create a function that takes in two words as input and returns an array of three elements, in the following order:

1.  Shared letters between two words.
2.  Letters unique to word 1.
3.  Letters unique to word 2.

Each element should have **unique** letters, and have each letter be **alphabetically sorted**.

### Examples

```js
letters("sharp", "soap") ➞ ["aps", "hr", "o"]

letters("board", "bored") ➞ ["bdor", "a", "e"]

letters("happiness", "envelope") ➞ ["enp", "ahis", "lov"]

letters("kerfuffle", "fluffy") ➞ ["flu", "ekr", "y"]
// Even with multiple matching letters (e.g. 3 f's), there should
// only exist a single "f" in your first element.

letters("match", "ham") ➞ ["ahm", "ct", ""]
// "ham" does not contain any letters that are not found already
// in "match".
```

### Notes

- Both words will be in lower case.
- You do not have to worry about punctuation, all words only have letters from `[a-z]`.
- If an element contains no letters, return an empty string (see last example).
