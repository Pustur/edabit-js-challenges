# ToString Hooking

`Arrays` `Functional Programming`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/P8eaoczqtnNAkm7Gs)

You have one job and one job only, to ruin the day of any unsuspecting victim using the `toString` function.

- Hook the String prototype `toString` to instead return a string that is in reverse.

### Examples

```js
"Hello World!".toString() ➞ "!dlroW olleH"

"My hooking function! :3".toString() ➞ "3: !noitcnuf gnikooh yM"

"RaceCar".toString() ➞ "raCecaR"
```

### Notes

Since you are not limited to a single function, try to think outside the box.
