# Count the Smiley Faces :)

`Loops` `Regex` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/pFbR2RAjeJmrf9tua)

Create a function that takes an array of strings and return the number of smiley faces contained within it. These are the components that make up a valid smiley:

- A smiley has **eyes**. Eyes can be `:` or `;`.
- A smiley has a **nose** but it doesn't have to. A nose can be `-` or `~`.
- A smiley has a **mouth** which can be `)` or `D`.

No other characters are allowed except for those mentioned above.

### Examples

```js
countSmileys([":)", ";(", ";}", ":-D"]) ➞ 2

countSmileys([";D", ":-(", ":-)", ";~)"]) ➞ 3

countSmileys([";]", ":[", ";*", ":$", ";-D"]) ➞ 1
```

### Notes

- You will always be given an array as input.
- An empty array should return 0.
- The order of each facial element will always be the same.
- Noses are optional (e.g. `:)` and `:-)` are both valid).
