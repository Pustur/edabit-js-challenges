# Algorithms: Binary Search

`Algorithms` `Validation`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/5puuiuvW48dEsjkzW)

Create a function that finds a target number in a list of prime numbers. Implement a **binary search algorithm** in your function. The target number will be from 2 through 97\. If the target is prime then return `"yes"` else return `"no"`.

### Examples

```js
var primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]

isPrime(primes, 3) ➞ "yes"

isPrime(primes, 4) ➞ "no"

isPrime(primes, 67) ➞ "yes"

isPrime(primes, 36) ➞ "no"
```

### Notes

- You could use built-in functions to solve this, but the point of this challenge is to see if you understand the **binary search algorithm**.
- The solution is in the **Resources** tab.
