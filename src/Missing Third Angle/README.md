# Missing Third Angle

`Algebra` `Math` `Numbers`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/djyXcJZAuezrSXJ4j)

You are given 2 out of 3 of the angles in a triangle, in degrees.

Write a function that classifies the missing angle as either `"acute"`, `"right"`, or `"obtuse"` based on its degrees.

- An **acute** angle is one smaller than 90 degrees.
- A **right** angle is one that is exactly 90 degrees.
- An **obtuse** angle is one greater than 90 degrees (but smaller than 180 degrees).

For example: `missingAngle(11, 20)` should return `"obtuse"`, since the missing angle would be 149 degrees, which makes it obtuse.

### Examples

```js
missingAngle(27, 59) ➞ "obtuse"

missingAngle(135, 11) ➞ "acute"

missingAngle(45, 45) ➞ "right"
```

### Notes

The sum of angles of any triangle is always 180 degrees.
