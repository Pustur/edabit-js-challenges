`Loops` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/GYfnaQhSmZWLEMx6P)

Return the smallest number of steps it takes to convert a string **entirely** into uppercase or **entirely** into lower case, whichever takes the fewest number of steps. A step consists of changing one character from lower to upper case, or vice versa.

### Examples

```js
stepsToConvert("abC") ➞ 1
// "abC" converted to "abc" in 1 step

stepsToConvert("abCBA") ➞ 2
// "abCBA" converted to "ABCBA" in 2 steps

stepsToConvert("aba") ➞ 0

stepsToConvert("abaCCC") ➞ 3
```

### Notes

- Return `0` if empty string.
- Return `0` if the string is already entirely in one case.
- Only alphabetic characters.
- Input has no spaces.
