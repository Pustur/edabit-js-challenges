`Math` `Numbers` `Validation`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/5X9SgidXaNf7pikbp)

Create a function that takes an array of "mostly" numbers and returns the sum of missing numbers, given that the array is sorted in ascending order. Watch out for strings!

### Examples

```js
sumOfMissingNums(["1", "3", "5", "7", "9"]) ➞ 4

sumOfMissingNums(["7", "3", "1", "9", "5"]) ➞ 4

sumOfMissingNums(["1", "5", "B", "9", "z"]) ➞ 6
```

### Notes

- Remember to sort the array so numbers are ascending!
- Also as mentioned, the data might be dirty! Clean out any filthy strings.
