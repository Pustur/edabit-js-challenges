# Equality Check

`Bugs` `Language Fundamentals` `Logic` `Validation`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/BGvTMfwxYDRbtaTJ3)

A friend of yours was asked to implement a simple function that verifies the equality of two different given values `a` and `b`, so that function must return `false` in every case. The only given condition is that he must use nothing more than the two variables names and the equal symbol `=` in his code (besides of `return`, obviously).

After testing, each given case fails returning `true`! Find the cause of the error and correct your friend's function.

### Examples

```js
checkEquality(1, true) ➞ false

checkEquality(0, false) ➞ false

checkEquality(1, "1") ➞ false
```
