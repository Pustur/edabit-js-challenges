Write a function that receives the time in 12-hour AM/PM format and returns a string representation of the time in military (24-hour) format.

### Examples

```js
convertTime('07:05:45PM') ➞ '19:05:45'

convertTime('12:40:22AM') ➞ '00:40:22'

convertTime('12:45:54PM') ➞ '12:45:54'
```

### Notes

- Midnight is 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock, and 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
- Noon is 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock, and 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
