# Find the Shared Letters between Two Strings

`Conditions` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/33EsK9mQzGGzRkXQT)

Given two strings, return a `string` containing only the letters shared between the two.

### Examples

```js
sharedLetters("house", "home") ➞ "eho"

sharedLetters("Micky", "mouse") ➞ "m"

sharedLetters("house", "villa") ➞ ""
```

### NotessharedLetters

- If none of the letters are shared, return an empty string.
- The function should be **case insensitive** (e.g. comparing `A` and `a` should return `a`).
- Sort the resulting string alphabetically before returning it.
