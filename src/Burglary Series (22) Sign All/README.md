# Burglary Series (22): Sign All

`Arrays` `Loops` `Objects`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/xrsiqZKrMoT2skt9i)

You finally receive the entire stolen list document from the police. You need to sign at the end of the document but also each sub-list corresponding to each room in your house where the items were stolen.

You are given two arguments, one object with nested objects and a string that corresponds to your name. The object already contains several `signature` properties, one on the root, the others on each nested object. Return an object with all containing `signature` values set to your name.

### Examples

```js
const obj = {
  kitchen: {
    painting: 100,
    piano: 1000,
    signature: "",
  },
  bathroom: {
    stereo: 220,
    signature: "",
  },
  signature: "",
};

signAll(obj, "Rocky") âžž {
  kitchen: {
    painting: 100,
    piano: 1000,
    signature: "Rocky",  // changed
  },
  bathroom: {
    stereo: 220,
    signature: "Rocky",  // changed
  },
  signature: "Rocky",  // changed
}
```

### Notes

- If you have suggestions on how to present or further test this challenge please leave a comment.
- This series is part of a [collection that focuses on objects](https://edabit.com/collection/6NzWEMSwrSw4fnKkL). If you are interested in following the breath-taking narrative skills of yours truly or just do some object focused challenges (the challenges are ordered in ascending difficulty order), you can more easily [do that here](https://edabit.com/collection/6NzWEMSwrSw4fnKkL).
