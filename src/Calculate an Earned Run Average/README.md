# Calculate an Earned Run Average

`Math` `Numbers` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/94RHwrv6PfaqEGYtr)

Create a function that returns an _Earned Run Average_ (ERA). An ERA is calculated by multiplying **9** by the quotient of _Earned Runs Allowed_ `er` divided by `ip` _Innings Pitched_.

In baseball statistics, _innings_ are represented with a fractional part of **.1** (1/3) or **.2** (2/3) to represent the number of _outs_ in an inning. A whole number or a number with a fractional part of **.0** represents a full inning with three _outs_. Check the **Resources** tab for a deeper explanation.

### Examples

```js
era(22, 99) ➞ 2.00

era(23, 99.1) ➞ 2.08

era(24, 99.2) ➞ 2.17
```

### Notes

- ERA is represented with a scale of _2_: **2.08**
- For 1/3 and 2/3, use a scale of _2_.
