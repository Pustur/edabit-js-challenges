# Simplifying to Simplest Ratio

`Math` `Numbers` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/cAvXoLephroL2dKRp)

Create a function which _simplifies_ a given **fraction** into its **simplest ratio**. Return the fraction as a _string_.

### Examples

```js
simplifyFrac("2/4") ➞ "1/2"

simplifyFrac("15/25") ➞ "3/5"

simplifyFrac("4/9") ➞ "4/9"
```

### Notes

- Fractions are given as strings.
- Return the same fraction if it is already in its simplified ratio (see example #3).
