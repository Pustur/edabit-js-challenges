`Data Structures` `Objects` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/cgSmKhr3Hzez2Pt9n)

Try to remove any repeated charcters in a word that will be passed to our function. Any character could be used, even special ones and numbers.

### Examples

```js
unrepeated("hello") ➞ "helo"

unrepeated("aaaaa") ➞ "a"

unrepeated("WWE!!!") ➞ "WE!"

unrepeated("call 911") ➞ "cal 91"
```

### Notes

- No more than two words will be passed.
- Try to use new data type introduced in ES6.
- Notice that a string is iterable.
