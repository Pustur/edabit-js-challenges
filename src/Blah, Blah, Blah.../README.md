# Blah, Blah, Blah...

`Formatting` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/sTk6vyGewy3vZbZkD)

Create a function which replaces the last `n` words with `"blah"`. Add `"..."` to the last blah.

### Examples

```js
blahBlah("A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called",  5) ➞ "A function is a block of code which only blah blah blah blah blah..."

blahBlah("one two three four five", 2) ➞ "one two three blah blah..."

blahBlah("Sphinx of black quartz judge my vow", 10) ➞ "blah blah blah blah blah blah blah..."
```

### Notes

- If `n` is longer than the amount of words in the sentence, replace every word with "blah" (see example #3).
- All blahs shall be lowercase!
