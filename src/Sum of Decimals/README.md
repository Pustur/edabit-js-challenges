# Sum of Decimals

`Bugs` `Math` `Numbers`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/cwZQWhHHDTHP4ASbu)

Captain Obvious is asked to implement a simple function that given two decimal numbers A and B returns their sum.

"Easy one!" he _obviously_ thinks, but soon he discovers that his function fails over the fifty percent of given test cases! He _obviously_ suspects that cases results are wrong but his calculator is saying that they are correct! What's happening?

Can you help Captain Obvious to debug, correct his function and solve the exercise?

### Examples

```js
floatSum(0.3, 0.7) ➞ 1

floatSum(0.35, 0.75) ➞ 1.1

floatSum(1.234, 5.6789) ➞ 6.9129
```

### Notes

- Given numbers can be either integers or float with 1 up to 6 decimals.
- Don't round results!
- Bonus: can you resolve it using a simple math expression instead of a built-in method?
