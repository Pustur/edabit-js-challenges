[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/EzxPadgs3Y9hYWymS)

Given a range of years as a string, return the **number of leap years** there are within the range (inclusive).

### Examples

```js
numLeapYears("1980-1984") ➞ 2
// 1980 and 1984 are leapyears.

numLeapYears("2000-2020") ➞ 6

numLeapYears("1600-2000") ➞ 98
```

### Notes

- Remember that a _hyphen_ separates the years.
- Check the **Resources** tab for help on checking whether a year is a leap year.
