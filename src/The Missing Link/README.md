# The Missing Link

`Algorithms` `Numbers`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/M6hcm6ezCoRBbANQr)

Your function will get an array with a number sequence. However, one item will be missing. It's your job to find out whitch one is not in the array.

`[1, 3, 4, 5]`, `2` is missing so the output has to be `2`.

### Examples

```js
missing([1, 3, 4, 5]) ➞ 2

missing([2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 16]) ➞ 12

missing([1.5, 2, 3]) ➞ 2.5
```

### Notes

- The item that is missing, wil never be the smallest or largest number in the array.
- In every array, exactly one item is missing.
