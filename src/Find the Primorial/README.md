[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/86Dbfov3HDpKTArwo)

A _Primorial_ is a product of prime numbers (e.g. `2 x 3 x 5 = 30`). `2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13` are prime numbers. If `n` was `3`, you'd multiply `2 x 3 x 5 = 30` or Primorial = `30`.

Create a function that returns the Primorial of a number.

### Examples

```js
primorial(1) ➞ 2

primorial(2) ➞ 6

primorial(8) ➞ 9699690
```
