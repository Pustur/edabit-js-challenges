# Valid Variable Names

`Conditions` `Strings`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/cGXwWujXdkx6BS3CX)

When creating variables, the variable name must **always start with a letter**, though numbers and underscores are allowed to be contained in it also.

Create a function which returns `true` if a given variable name is valid, otherwise return `false`.

### Examples

```js
variableValid("result") ➞ true

variableValid("odd_nums") ➞ true

variableValid("2TimesN") ➞ false
```

### Notes

- Inputs are given as strings.
- Variable names with spaces are not allowed.
- Although this question may seem like otherwise, you can't actually assign words with quotes around them as variables.
- The rules exposed in this challenge are an oversimplification on how variable and identifier names are considered valid in JavaScript.
