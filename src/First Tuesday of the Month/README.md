Every month, Microny™️ (a big entertainment corporation) publishes a few free videogames on their web store.  
You are working on a script that will notify you whenever the new games become available for download.  
There is not a fixed date for the new releases, but you know that it happens every first Tuesday of every month.  
Write a function that given a year and a month, returns a string with the date of when the new games will be available.

### Examples

```js
firstTuesdayOfTheMonth(1997, 1) ➞ '1997-01-07'
firstTuesdayOfTheMonth(2021, 2) ➞ '2021-02-02'
firstTuesdayOfTheMonth(2020, 3) ➞ '2020-03-03'
```

### Notes

- Months are given as numbers starting at 1 = January
