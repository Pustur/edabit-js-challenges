# Leaderboard Sort

`Arrays` `Objects` `Sorting`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/nTZqZmAkLrjRx9PcK)

Given an array of users, each defined by an object with the following properties: `name`, `score`, `reputation` create a function that sorts the array to form the correct leaderboard.

The leaderboard takes into consideration the score of each user of course, but an _emphasis_ is put on their `reputation` in the community, so to get the `trueScore`, you should add the `reputation` multiplied by `2` to the `score`.

Once you know the `trueScore` of each user, sort the array according to it in **descending order**.

### Examples

```js
leaderboards([
  { name: "a", score: 100, reputation: 20 },
  { name: "b", score: 90, reputation: 40 },
  { name: "c", score: 110, reputation: 30 },
]) âžž [
  { name: "c", score: 115, reputation: 30 }, // trueScore = 175
  { name: "b", score: 90, reputation: 40 },  // trueScore = 170
  { name: "a", score: 100, reputation: 20 }  // trueScore = 140
]
```
