# Throwing <N> Amount of Darts Find All Possible Combinations to Reach a Target Score

`Arrays` `Loops` `Recursion`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/YBZgzAxuyDtS9bomm)

You're given a dartboard divided into sections, each section has a **unique** score. That means there won't be two sections with the same score.

![Dartboard example](img/dartboard.png)

Throwing a certain amount of valid darts, find how many solutions there are to reach the target score. Your function will be passed three parameters...

- **Sections**: An array of values for the sections (e.g. `[3, 6, 8, 11, 15, 19, 22]`, the array is already sorted).

- **Darts**: The amount of darts to throw.

- **Target**: The target score.

Return an empty array if no solution is found, otherwise an array of non-duplicate strings for each solution (e.g. `["3-11-18", "7-7-18", "7-11-14"]`).

### Examples

If there are duplicate values, keep only the one sorted from smallest to biggest.

```
"8-19-8"

"8-8-19" <-- This is the one you would keep.

"19-8-8"
```

Multiple solutions should be sorted before returning them.

```
["3-11-18", "7-7-18", "7-11-14"] is ok.

["7-11-14", "7-7-18", "3-11-18"] is not ok.
```

### Notes

- Multiple darts **can** land in the same section.

- A dart **must** land in a valid section (it can't miss).
