Create a function that takes an array and returns the **difference** between the smallest and biggest numbers.

### Examples

```js
diffMaxMin([10, 4, 1, 4, -10, -50, 32, 21]) ➞ 82
// Smallest number is -50, biggest is 32.

diffMaxMin([44, 32, 86, 19]) ➞ 67
// Smallest number is 19, biggest is 86.
```
