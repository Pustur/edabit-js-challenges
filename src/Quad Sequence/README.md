`Algebra` `Math` `Numbers`

[View on Edabit](https://edabit.com/challenge/pZoKXf2ujZq65iWfD)

Write a function that receives an array of _x_ integers and returns an array of _x_ integers in the Nth term of a quadratic number sequence (where _x_ is the length of the incoming array).

### Examples

```js
quadSequence([48, 65, 84]) ➞ [105, 128, 153]

quadSequence([0, 1, 6, 15, 28]) ➞ [45, 66, 91, 120, 153]

quadSequence([9, 20, 33, 48]) ➞ [65, 84, 105, 128]
```

### Notes

Both positive and negative numbers are included in the test cases.
